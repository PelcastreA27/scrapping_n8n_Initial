#  Web Scraping & Data Formatting Flow with n8n

This project automates a complete data extraction and formatting workflow using **n8n**, **Google Sheets**, **Google Drive**, **OpenAI**, and **Firecrawl**.  
The main goal is to collect URLs from Google Sheets, extract and clean data from them, format the content into a structured JSON, and update a Google Docs file automatically.

---

##  Overview

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Extract URLs from Google Sheets**  
   The flow starts by reading a list of URLs stored in a Google Sheets document.

2. **Perform Web Scraping with Firecrawl**  
   Each URL is processed using **Firecrawl** to extract content and metadata.  
    *Make sure you have a Firecrawl account and install the Firecrawl module in n8n.*  
    You can sign up at: [https://firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)

3. **Generate Markdown & Data Formatting**  
   The scraped content is converted into Markdown format for better readability.

4. **Enhance and Clean Data with OpenAI**  
   The Markdown content is sent to **OpenAI** to generate a cleaner, more structured JSON output.

5. **Update Google Drive Documents**  
   A new document is created (or updated) in **Google Drive** with the formatted content.

6. **Update the Source Google Sheet**  
   The Google Sheet is automatically updated with the new information, ensuring synchronization between data sources.

7. **Update the Google Docs Syllabus**  
   The flow updates a syllabus or documentation file in **Google Docs**, keeping your content aligned and up to date.

Before running the workflow, make sure you have:

- An **n8n** instance running (locally or in the cloud)
- Connected **Google Sheets**, **Google Drive**, and **OpenAI** credentials
- A **Firecrawl** account and API key

##  Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
2. Import the workflow (.json file) into n8n.

3. Install the Firecrawl module in n8n (if not already available).

4. Configure credentials for:

     Google Sheets

     Google Drive

     OpenAI

     Firecrawl


5. Run the workflow manually or schedule it using n8n triggers.
  
      
6. Output Example

The final JSON output generated by OpenAI might look like this:
{
  "title": "Web Automation with n8n",
  "summary": "This document explains how to build an automated scraping and formatting flow using n8n, Firecrawl, and OpenAI.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Getting Started",
      "content": "You need to configure your credentials and import the workflow."
    }
  ]
}
Notes

You can modify the Google Sheets schema to include additional metadata (categories, tags, or processing status).

Firecrawl is a paid service — depending on your usage, you might need an API plan.

OpenAI prompts can be customized to output Markdown, JSON, or plain text.
